# Tic-Tac-Toe

##Introduction
This was a group project assigned in my Computer Programming II class (Java Programming). It is a replica of the childhood game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game includes a gameboard GUI, easy/hard mode, new game button, a three by three board with buttons to select position, and a scoreboard located at the bottom.
