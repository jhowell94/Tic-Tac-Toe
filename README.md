# Tic-Tac-Toe

##Introduction
This was a group project assigned in my Computer Programming II class (Java Programming). It is a replica of the childhood game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game includes a gameboard GUI, easy/hard mode, new game button, a three by three board with buttons to select position, and a scoreboard located at the bottom. 


##Instructions
**Remember that TicTacToe.java must be compiled first**
* After the project has been compiled, the gameboard Gui will apear, and the user is automatically assigned to X's.

* You can choose either the easy game mode or the hard game mode. One you have chosen a dificulty, you can not change until that game is over.

* Once the game is over, the buttons on the board will fade out, and the resut will be shown under the comments section. Also, A point will be added under either the Draw, X, or O section.

* Once you feel like you have gotten to where you have "mastered" the easy mode, you can selct the hard mode for a change of pace

* When you are done playing the game, just exit out of the GUI, and that will conclude your gaming session.

##Notes
The hard mode (HardAI) was the most difficult part of this project for the two of us. We found it rather difficult to work out how  to get it to respond the correct way.
